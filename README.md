Raw-data file provided by @CodeBasics is for MySql, and I am more Familiar with MS-SQL.

So first, I create load database in MySql, then create new database in MS-SQL server and migrate data into it from MySql server using SSMA( SQL Server Migration Assistant) tool.

After that, I begin work on project, ad-hock-request one by one.

You can get Both Request and Answers (SQL Code) in "AnswersScript.SQL" in above code section,
